### Week 6 Blog: Capstone Assignment
	The digital history course which I have been enrolled in for the first part of the 2019 Summer semester has been very engaging, and troublesome at times. However, I have come to really enjoy this course and have developed a lot of new digital skills. While engaging with course material, I would often find myself at times questioning “why am I doing this” or “what does this accomplish.” When learning digital history, it is important to understand why you are imputing a common and what that command ultimately does and changes. At the beginning of this course, Dr. Graham noted that the community is critical when learning digital history, and this cannot be farther from the truth. Throughout not only the exercises but as well the capstone projects, I would get stuck on a variety of things such as creating a new branch for exercise 4.3 to finding the location of a picture for my capstone project. What I found to be extremely valuable was the slack community where I could ask others or Dr. Graham for help, and as well a few friends I made in the class. As I am not very ‘digitally’ skilled, I found the aid of peers to be very beneficial as I could ask them about a problem that I was facing, or what the command that I was putting in does. I found a few skills that I learned from the exercises to be helpful when working on my final capstone assignment, but none other than the resilience that I developed to be the most beneficial. The capstone assignment was difficult at first to tackle, but when I asked members of the class to meet up to work on class exercises, a few of us decided that we could pool our skills together and finish the final assignment together. Now that I have finished working on the capstone assignment, I will have to say that working on it with other group members, and sharing what we learned together was one of the most satisfying parts of this course, and was extremely beneficial to all of our learning progress. 

	In order to tackle the assignment first, my capstone group first all met up to go over Sebastian Mol’s original project to find inconsistencies and things that we throughout needed to be improved or changed. We decided to organize the assignment on Maggie’s GitHub, and Maggie and I created a “project” on GitHub where we could write down what needed to be completed, and how to go about it. With the assignment being laid out, and knowing what we all needed to do, we broke up and worked on parts of the tasks on our own branches (which we learned how to do from Week 2 exercise 4), that way the work we did does not collide with each other.  Maggie was tasked with working on the Northwest Territories locations, Ruzbeh was to work on the location in the GTA and Northern Ontario, and I was to work on the Montreal, Ontario-Quebec, and BC location. We decided to split the work like this as the Northwest Territories were in what we deemed good condition, which would allow Maggie to work on fixing the bar by updating the Carleton logo and to change to the map and colours. Ruzbeh had the two Ontario locations as he was busy with work, and was not sure about his digital skill sets, which allowed him to focus more on the research aspect of the assignment. I took the remaining three, as I wanted to work on fixing what was wrong with BC, as I discovered in this course that I enjoy fixing broken thing, and the Montreal and Deep River one, as it would require me to do research, and reorganizing the formatting of the page. 
	When dealing with the Trail, BC page, I found that it was not correctly linked. Once I had located the whereabouts of the file, I was able to add the file location to the command, allowing for a “more details” button. Once I arrived at the page, I soon found out that none of the information was accurate. In order to fix this, I did some research on heavy water production and its valuable contribution to atomic research. I also wanted to add a picture which would explain the importance of heavy water in atomic weapons and research. In order to add a picture, I first had to upload the photo to the central hub. Once the picture was uploaded, I then needed to grab the location of it to add to the file, in order to input it to the page. When working on my other Ontario and Quebec locations, I found that the references were not linked to how I would like. I figured that it would make more sense to have the link of the reference located on the title of the source rather than the publisher. Therefore, I moved the location of the link, and at the same time, changed the font to make it italicized. I found it to be more important to have the title standout, rather than the other parts of the references.
Another thing which I had changed throughout the files was the font size of sub-headers. All of the sub headers were the same sizes as the titles, and I found this not to look good and does not show the importance of the title. Therefore, I hanged all the fronts from h3 to h4. 
	My group member Ruzbeh ran into trouble with the relinking of the location of the references, creating new headings and paragraphs, and merging his work to the final project. I was able to help him sort through these troubles over the phone and slack chat. I was able to show him the work that I produced in my BC file as an example and help explain to him what each command does and how it will change the work. Ruzbeh found this helpful and was glad to have my work as an example or template of how he should reconfigure his. Maggie also helped me throughout this assignment when I ran into difficulties. I was originally having trouble uploading my photo to the BC page, as I would put a location in, but it would not appear. Maggie pointed out that I needed first to upload the image to the main file and to use that location. This made a lot more sense then what I was previously doing. 	
	Through taking this course, I discovered that my greatest weakness relates to API’s. It found it to be challenging to complete this exercise back in week 3 exercise 4. I struggled with understanding how, and why this is done and spent many hours trying to get it to work. I am also not very good at using “R,” as I find it to be confusing and challenging. I tried having some fellow classmates explain its purpose better to me, but still, I find it to be confusing as I always ran into troubles while using it. Somethings that I did learn about myself as a historian, and my strengths would be that first there is no one way of doing things, and I really enjoyed that part in this course, as some of my capstone group members used DH box to edit capstone files, whereas I used the main file on GitHub. I also learned that I am very good with mapping, and I have come to enjoy it. I had previously done an assignment using GIS mapping before, but I soon realized that it did not achieve what I was looking for, whereas the map stretching would have made that assignment better. While working on the map stretching exercise for this class, I soon found that I was able to do it very quickly and right. I hope to continue to use this skill, particularly going forward for future assignments! As well, my final skill which I developed in this course, or more or less improved upon is the ability to go over something and indicate weaknesses, and wrong information. I discovered this strength throughout this course when I would have to go back and see why a command that I entered into GitHub did not make the necessary changes that I wanted, and also during my capstone assignment when I went back to edit and improve another persons work. This skill is extremely valuable and is transferable to any field of study or position, and I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to develop it, and to identify that I have it during this course. 
	I am very grateful that I took this course, as I have learned a lot of new digital skills which I hope to not just use in my graduate program moving forward, but as well in my future professions, and classes. This course was tough when starting, but I soon learned that it was definitely worth the struggle. I am proud that I managed to be able to complete every exercise assigned to us, at the beginning of the class when I looked over the workbook, I was worried at first whether I would be able to complete it. I found that as long as I took breaks in between exercises and came back, it would give me a clear mind, and I was able to complete it.
