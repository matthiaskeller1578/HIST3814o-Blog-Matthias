#### Readings
This week we are examining digitalizing manuscripts. While doing the readings, I found it very interesting reading about how historians are digitalizing manuscripts for others to do digitalized research. I have not had firsthand experience digitalizing manuscripts, although I wish to learn a bit about it, I have however utilized a large variety of digitalized documents. This year I helped my grandmother find out whom her father was by doing intensive searches online. My Grandmother was born during the Second World War in England, but unfortunately, her father died in combat, and she never met him, or his family. However, this year, I did searching online through the British armed forces archives which are now digitalized, and other censuses which were conducted in England during the war, which helped me find out who he was, where and how he died, and who his family members were. With this information, I was able to track down my grandmother's third cousin on her fathers’ side, who is still helping us get in contact with her first cousins! I have also accessed digitalized marriage, baptism, and property records in Germany through the German government to find out more about my fathers, father and his family. With this information, I was able to track down my grandfathers’ movements around the world until he reached Brazil, which does not have good digitalized records and has stumped me. That is why I found the readings from _______ to be of particular interests.

The digitalization of manuscripts from ship logs to newspapers is essential as most of this information is slowly being lost and falling apart. Digitalizing these sources will allow this information to live on forever and is vital for historians to do research. Utilizing coding to develop words which can be searched through pictures, symbols and unreadable words will save researchers a lot of time and can aid in providing greater insight. It reminds me a bit of the annotations that we do for this class. Where we can annotate particular parts, and we can all help each other to understand further what that part means.
