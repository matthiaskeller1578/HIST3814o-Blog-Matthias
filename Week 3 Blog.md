#### Readings
This week we are examining digitalizing manuscrtipts.
While doing the readings I found it very interesting reading aboubt how hisotirans are digitalizing manuscripts for others to do digitalized research. I have not had first hand experice digitalizing manuscripts, although I wish to learn a bit about it, I have how ever utilized a large variety of digitalized manuscripts. This year I helped my grandmother findout who her father was by doing intensive searches online. My Grandmother was born during the Second World War in Engand, but unfortuanlty her father died in comabt and she never met him, or his family. But this year, I did searching online through the British armed forces archives which are now dgitalized, and other censuses which were conducted in England during the war, which helped me find out who he was, where and how he died, and who his family members were. With this information I was able to track down my grandmothers third counsin on her fathers side who is still helping us get in contact whith her first cousins! I have also accessed digitalized marriage, baptism, and property records in Germany through the German government to find out more about my fathers, father and his family. With this information I was able to track down my grandfathers movements around the world until he reached Brazil, which does not have good digitalized records and has stumped me. That is why I found the readings from _______ to be of particualr interests.

The digitalization of manuscaripts from ship logs to newspapers are exermly important as most of this information is slowly being lost and falling apart. Digitalizing these sources will allow this information to live on frever and is importnat for historians to do research. Utilizing coding to develop words which can be searched through pictures, symbols and un-redable words will save researchers a lot of time, and can aid in providing greater insight. It reminds me a bit of the annotations that we do for this class. Where we are able to annotate particular parts and we can all help each other to further understand what that part means.
