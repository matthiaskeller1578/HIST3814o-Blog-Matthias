## Week 4 Blog

This week we are looking into wrangling data, while also looking at sources from the Republic of Texas images. 
This week we are going to be building upon what we learned last week, which I belive will be a bit challenging as I found difficulty with last weeks exercises. However, I am excited to learn about the Republic of Texas, as I find its history to be interesting! I have always wanted to learn more about Texas' history, as I recently foud out that some of my ancestors were the original settler and founders of Keller, Texas. What a great way to incorprate my intrest of Texan histroy and digital history!
