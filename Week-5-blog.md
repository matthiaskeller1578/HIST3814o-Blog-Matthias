### Week 5 Blog

I am finally finishing up all of the exercises, and I have to admit I did enjoy this course. At first I was worried that this course was going to be very difficult, which at times it was, but I found once we got towards the mapping at the end, I began to enjoy the course even more. I am very happy with the skills that I learned which I hope to not only use during my capstone project for next week, but as well my masters proram in egovernance (digital government)! My biggest stuggle this week was the Java, but that is alright, as I found it to be a learning lesson, and I gained valuable insight, and learned important things in exercises 8 and 10. 

## Reading and Theme: 
This week Dr. Graham asked us to consider the question: who benefits from this? Who is hurt from this? while engaging with the readings. 
The article [using metadata to find paul revere](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) examines the relaionships between individuals and organizations in the British colonies. It is designed to find out through what means people are connected, to therefore determine which groups are a threat to the British crown (terrorist groups). It was extremly interesting as well to see how Revere was connected to all those people through group membership, and the influence he could have and share.
I found this reading to be very interesting, and probably my favourtie reading for this course as I am ver interested in security and national defence. 
to answer the theme from the reading I would have to say that [security, government, and polling groups](https://hyp.is/77iuVovWEemcPSfpd_EVIQ/kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) would find this to be of benefit as it allows them to group people. Intellegence organizations such as CSIS in Canada would benefit from this as they would be able to find terrorists online through facebook or twitter data!
Those who do not benefit from this is the average person who might just be linked to individuals by mistake or are relatives. This does bring about the question of what is personal data, but my answer to that is, if you want your data to be personal, keep it to yourself and dont put it online as it can always be accessable. 
When reading [dankad's annotation](https://hyp.is/L8lIAoezEemJFo8cLyz6kg/kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/), I began to really consider the impliations on privacy in regard to people being able to paint a picture of who you are by who you associate yourself with. This technology can defenitly be missused.

The article concludes that there is [a potential to discover or create misleading information](https://hyp.is/PBDIRIvaEemVZS_AxcPWnQ/kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) whith metadata, and that defenitly is a big concern which should always be considered when conducting research. The question "do I have more supporting data to back this up" should always be asked when using metadata in my opinion. 


# To give some background on why I chose these two:
This week I did exercise 8 and 10 as they would be the most benefical to my capstone project.

#### Exercise 8
Exercise 8 was really cool, as I learned about finding old historical maps, and then how to place points on a current google map and then place an old map over top as the final. I think this is valuable because it it helps show where the place was during that time period, and does not show what it is like now with new buildings like Tim Hortons and McDonalds. It is important to be able to see what it was like during that time period. I hope to transfer this over to my final capstone, by having the map of where the atomic research was conducted and the buildings which are there!


#### Exercise 10
Exercise ten will be benefical to the completion of my capstone project because we hope to first off change the overall world map to just Canada, as it is the only area of focus. Therefore we hope to make Canada more interactive, adn I belive that I can accomplish this through QGIS. I had used GIS mapping before in another history class in which I tracked to expullsion of ethnic Germans from across Europe after World War II. But QGIS mapping seems as though it would have been more benefical to use- I wish I had it for earlier projects it seems really cool! I think maybe when I am done this course, I will go back and maybe redo that assignment using both exercise 8 and 10 from this week for my own hobby. 

Having a more interactive map of Canada would benefit our capstone project a lot, and therefore I want to try and transfer what I learned here into my final project.
