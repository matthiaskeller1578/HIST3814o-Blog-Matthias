### Week 5 Blog


## Reading and Theme: 
This week Dr. Graham asked us to consider the question: who benefits from this? Who is hurt from this? while engaging with the readings. 
The article [using metadata to find paul revere](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) examines the relaionships between individuals and organizations in the British colonies. It is designed to find out through what means people are connected, to therefore determine which groups are a threat to the British crown (terrorist groups). It was extremly interesting as well to see how Revere was connected to all those people through group membership, and the influence he could have and share.
I found this reading to be very interesting, and probably my favourtie reading for this course as I am ver interested in security and national defence. 
to answer the theme from the reading I would have to say that [security, government, and polling groups](https://hyp.is/77iuVovWEemcPSfpd_EVIQ/kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) would find this to be of benefit as it allows them to group people. Intellegence organizations such as CSIS in Canada would benefit from this as they would be able to find terrorists online through facebook or twitter data!
Those who do not benefit from this is the average person who might just be linked to individuals by mistake or are relatives. This does bring about the question of what is personal data, but my answer to that is, if you want your data to be personal, keep it to yourself and dont put it online as it can always be accessable. 
When reading [dankad's annotation](https://hyp.is/L8lIAoezEemJFo8cLyz6kg/kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/), I began to really consider the impliations on privacy in regard to people being able to paint a picture of who you are by who you associate yourself with. This technology can defenitly be missused.
